              <p>Westies are a small breed.  Whilst they are members of the Terrier family, they are not typical naughty terriers – they tend to be known more for their stubbornness. Average life span for Westies is 12 – 14 years.</p>

              <p>Westies are playful, loyal and intelligent and can be trained well from an early age. They make excellent family dogs and don’t need much space to run around. They make excellent companions</p>

              <p>In terms of general health, Westies have no genetic or breed-related health concerns.  They are generally quite hearty.  Being white dogs, they can have some issues with sun or skin ailments but these are rare.</p>
